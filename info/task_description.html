    <i>Sofia has had a very stressful month and decided to take a vacation for a week.
       To avoid any stress during her vacation she wants to forward emails with
       a stressful subject line to Stephen.</i>
</p>

<p>
    The function should recognize if a subject line is stressful.
    A stressful subject line means that all letters are in uppercase, and/or ends
    by at least 3 exclamation marks, and/or contains at least one of the following
    “red” words: "help", "asap", "urgent". Any of those "red" words can be spelled
    in different ways - "HELP", "help", "HeLp", "H!E!L!P!", "H-E-L-P", even in a
    very loooong way "HHHEEEEEEEEELLP," they just can't have any other letters interspersed between them.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input:</strong> Subject line as a string.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output:</strong> Boolean.
