    <div class="answer">
        The general idea is to check the input string with three conditions.
        For the third of them you need to convert words with some additional
        operations.

    <div class="question">
        How to start this checking?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        The first condition - all letters are in upper case. You can make this checking
        with string method <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_isupper.asp">str.isupper()</a>.
        It returns True when all letters in string are uppercase:
        <br />
        <br />
        <pre class="brush: python">
cond1 = subj.isupper()
        </pre>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        Looks simple, but I don't feel confident. Need a hint with next step.
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        The second condition - the input string ends with three exclamation sings.
        And Python is so cool, that again it has the string method with such name: 
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_endswith.asp">str.endswith()</a>.
        Use it for checking the second condition: 
        <br />
        <br />
        <pre class="brush: python">
cond2 = subj.endswith("!!!")        
        </pre>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
    <div class="question">
        Ok, but the third condition is more difficult. How to check it?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        Let's think, what you should do and then "translate" it into code.
        The string is stressful if any word in it is in sequence ("help", "asap", "urgent").
        But this word should be converted before checking. To implement this idea into code
        you need function <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_any.asp">any()</a>,
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists_comprehension.asp">list comprehension</a>,
        function <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_map.asp">map()</a> to use 
        some function to each element in sequence. And of course, the string should
        be splitted into separate words with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_split.asp">str.split()</a> string method.
        <br />
        <br />
        <pre class="brush: python">
cond3 = any(word in ("help", "asap", "urgent")
            for word in map(convert, subj.split()))        
        </pre>
        The function "convert" is not written yet.

        I need a hint with writing this additional function.

    <div class="answer">
        Each word should be "cleaned" from non-letter characters between word
        letters and from repetition letters. Since your "red" words are in lowercase, 
        the words in string should be as well. So inside function you should create
        new empty string variable, which you will return, and iterate over the each
        characters in lowercase input word:
    <br />
    <br />
        <pre class="brush: python">
def convert(word: str) -> str:

    s = ""
    for char in word.lower():
        ...

    return s

    <div class="question">
        How to rid of repetition and non-letter characters?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        You should add characters to new string if they are letters (use string 
        method <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_isalpha.asp">str.isalpha()</a>)
        and if the new string is empty or the last character in new string is not equal
        to current character:
    <br />
    <br />
        <pre class="brush: python">
def convert(word: str) -> str:

    s = ""
    for char in word.lower():
        if char.isalpha() and (not s or s[-1] != char):
            s += char

    return s
        </pre>

    <div class="question">
        So, how my final solution should look like?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        You should wrap the code from first function into function expression and
        add return statement with any() function with all conditions. If any of them
        is True - the letter subject is stressed. Here is the solution:
        <br />
        <br />
        <pre class="brush: python">
def is_stressful(subj: str) -> bool:

    cond1 = subj.isupper()
    cond2 = subj.endswith("!!!")
    cond3 = any(word in ("help", "asap", "urgent")
                for word in map(convert, subj.split()))
    
    return any([cond1, cond2, cond3])

def convert(word: str) -> str:
    
    s = ""
    for char in word.lower():
        if char.isalpha() and (not s or s[-1] != char):
            s += char
    
    return s
